/**
 * @title  OperatorFilterer
 * @notice Abstract contract whose constructor automatically registers and optionally subscribes to or copies another
 *         registrant's entries in the OperatorFilterRegistry.
 * @dev    This smart contract is meant to be inherited by token contracts so they can use the following:
 *         - `onlyAllowedOperator` modifier for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` methods.
 *         - `onlyAllowedOperatorApproval` modifier for `approve` and `setApprovalForAll` methods.
 *         Please note that if your token contract does not provide an owner with EIP-173, it must provide
 *         administration methods on the contract itself to interact with the registry otherwise the subscription
 *         will be locked to the options set during construction.
